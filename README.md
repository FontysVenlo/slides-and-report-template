# Presentation slides and report template
<!-- .slide: data-background="images/slides-headline-background.jpg" -->

A useful template for making your slides with markdown and revealjs and on top of that create a nice pdf with eisvogel template.

<!-- s -->

## Why?

- normal presentations kind of boring<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- still differnces in the platforms even for MS power point, e.g. Windows, Mac or Linux.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Usually you multiple sources and multiple output documents so not only slides but maybe also papers you would like to provide for the students.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- These papers are currently in pdf form delivered to the students, and can also be simple pdfs of the slides.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Solution wanted having one single source and decide what to have in the slides and maybe also additional and more detaillled information in a paper as pdf, docx or webpage.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- s -->

## Current solution

- [The HTML presentation framework | reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentations.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- is still tech based (HTML)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Now based on Markdown, as simple language<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Simple to write and support for transforming it into other document types, e.g. with pandoc is pretty good.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
